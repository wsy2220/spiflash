#Packet format

ACK, STX, ETX are ASCII control characters
##Master:

Type:	STX		MODE	Inum	Onum	DATA	...		ETX

No:		0		1		2-3		3-4		5		...		Inum+6

##Programmer:

##On success

Type:	ACK		STX		DATA	...		ETX

No:		0		1		2		...		Onum+2

##On Fail

Type:	NAK

No:		0

NAK will be sent at any time when the programmer detects an error.

#MODE

## Standard mode (MODE = 0)

Programmer will send ACK after a whole packet have sent in.

## Stream mode (MODE = 1)

The master sends the packet header (including Inum and Onum) and wait for ACK,
then sends the remaining part of the packet

After that the programmer will return a full packet. 

That's to say, the programmer will send a extra ACK to confirm header.
